    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <p>
      KUNE Festival blends art, music, and nature, offering an immersive
      experience. The art promotes open discussions and a positive impact on our
      worldview. The music represents the young Nordic artistic community. KUNE
      values and celebrates the Otherness of the world, recognizing diversity
      and promoting inclusivity. The Otherness element invites us to appreciate
      unique perspectives and gain a more complex understanding of humanity.

    <h2>THE LOCATION</h2>
    <p>
      The island was a 19th-century defense fort, now repurposed for cultural
      initiatives. It accommodates 2500 people, with 1000 in camping. Traveling
      to KUNE Festival by boat adds a unique element, creating an escape from
      everyday life. The festival's location on the island creates a close-knit
      community, promoting social interactions impossible in daily life. The
      island's transformation from aggression to community symbolizes hope.
      Hosting the festival on this historic site reminds us of the positive
      impact of art and culture, bringing people together and fostering
      connection.
